# Chicago Crime
An investigation of crime in Chicago. Investigating effect of warm days on homicides. Eventually attempt at predicting homicides. 
____
Previous investigation, http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/brianckeegan/WeatherCrime/blob/master/Analysis.ipynb, focused on large scale techniques. In this I attempt to identify days ripe for murder taking into account net temp change and weather prior (days likely spent more inside vs warm weather/nice -> outside). Eventually I hope to have a model that can predict days ripe for murder by tweaking my model.
